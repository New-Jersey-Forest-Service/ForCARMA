# ðŸŒ³ Welcome to ForCARMA! ðŸŒ²
The Forest Carbon and Risk Modeling Assessment, or ForCARMA, is focused primarily on managing for carbon storage and sequestration, taking risks like wildfire and insect outbreaks into account. One of our project goals is to be able to demonstrate carbon tradeoffs amidst a variety of management and risk scenarios to help influence on-the-ground management, and to see how these forest management strategies align with the emissions goals outlined within â€¯[New Jersey's Global Warming Response Act (GWRA) 80x50 Report](dep.nj.gov/wp-content/uploads/climatechange/nj-gwra-80x50-report-2020.pdf) â€¯and the â€¯[New Jersey State Forest Action Plan](https://nj.gov/dep/parksandforests/forest/njsfap/).
